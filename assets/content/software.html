  <p>A showcase of software projects I have worked on or been involved in.</p>

  <h3>Side Projects</h3>
  <p>
    This website itself was handcrafted by me using a mixture of HTML, CSS,
    HTMX, and Hyperscript as a fun experiment.
  </p>
  <h4>Fortunes</h4>
  <p>
    While in college I made a "game" called Fortunes using C++ that generates a
    detailed "fortune cookie" of your future life
  </p>
  <p>
    I began writing it in early college and had finished it about halfway
    through.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a great experience, I learned a lot, I even used world census data
    for names and divorce rates for the randomizer.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I took some more advanced classes I started to rewrite it because I
    realized how much it could be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    I still have a lot of work to do on it, but it has been a great learning
    experience.

  <h3>Collaborations</h3>
  <h4>Word Norms</h4>
  <p>
    In 2012, I worked with the Human Factors Lab at the University of South
    Dakota on their word norms research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made some tooling to help input and analyze significant quantities of
    textual data,<br />
    and these programs were used by more than half a dozen people who were
    working on this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis tool was made in C++ and the input tool was made in Visual
    Basic.net

      <p>
        I competed in two regional programming competitions<br />our teams
        achieved 2nd place in both
      </p>
      <p>
        2013 we used C++ as a 2-person team.<br />
