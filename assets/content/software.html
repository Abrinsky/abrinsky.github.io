    inventory tracking interface, an ERP system,
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>
      In previous, less technical roles, I frequently made extensive use of
      office software such as excel to empower business decisions.<br />
    </span>
    <span>
      I developed numerous individual and collaborative tools that significantly
      enhanced productivity.
    </span>

  <p>
    <strong>Personal Projects:</strong>
    <span> I have worked on a wide range of projects, including:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools for engineering/ergonomics(human factors students) research</li>
    <li>Sheets for personal finance and budgeting</li>
    <li>
      Personal tools to assist in digital economy in games<br />
      (sales, tracking, inventory management)

  <h3>Side Projects</h3>
  <p>
    This website itself was handcrafted by me using a mixture of HTML, CSS,
    HTMX, and Hyperscript as a fun experiment.
  </p>
  <h4>Fortunes</h4>
  <p>
    While in college (2011) I made a game called Fortunes using C++ that generates a
    detailed "fortune cookie" of your future life
  </p>
  <p>
    I began writing it in early college and had finished it about halfway
    through.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a great experience, I learned a lot, I even used world census data
    for names and divorce rates for the randomizer.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I took some more advanced classes I started to rewrite it because I
    realized how much it could be improved.
  </p>

  <h3>Collaborations</h3>
  <h4>Word Norms</h4>
  <p>
    In 2012, I worked with the Human Factors Lab at the University of South
    Dakota on their word norms research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made some tooling to help input and analyze significant quantities of
    textual data,<br />
    and these programs were used by more than half a dozen people who were
    working on this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis tool was made in C++ and the input tool was made in Visual
    Basic.net
