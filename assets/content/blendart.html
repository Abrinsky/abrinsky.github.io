  <h1 class="title">3D Art</h1>
  <p>
    A showcase of 3D art projects I have worked on or been involved in.<br />
    I started following a basic class on blender which gave me some basic
    skills.<br />
    Then, I got really into doing logos to practice materials and different
    lighting and composition techniques.<br />
    After that I followed a lesson on turning lines into shapes. (The
    pottery)<br />
    Finally, I have been following along on a course in my spare time on simple
    character modeling. <br />
    I hope to continue to improve my skills. Maybe eventually get into hard
    surface modeling, making assets, and/or doing animations.
